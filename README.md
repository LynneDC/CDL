DESCRIPTION
<h3>
<p>
This project is about building a website that will host all Christian materials and multimedia.
This website is available for everyone but the main target is for anyone who wants to learn about Christianity
This will solve a problem I personally experienced when I was searching for a particular topic on both google and Chabot. My search result was not selective and I had to search more to find the results I wanted. This became time consuming for me.
